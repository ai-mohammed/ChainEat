# ChainEat

## Project Overview

ChainEats is a web-based application designed to streamline the dining experience across multiple restaurant locations. Unlike traditional single-restaurant apps, ChainEats allows users to explore a network of restaurants, make reservations, browse menus, post reviews, and participate in a loyalty program.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** [ChainEats Backend](https://chaineat-9acv.onrender.com) (Node.js & Express.js)
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Features

- **Restaurant Discovery & Location Finder:** Users can search and filter restaurants by location, cuisine, or rating.
- **Online Table Reservation System:** Customers can book tables in real-time, selecting date, time, and party size.
- **Menu Browsing:** Users can view restaurant menus.
- **User Profiles & Loyalty Program:** Registered users can track reservation history and earn loyalty points.
