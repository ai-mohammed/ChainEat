          We are a team of third-year Computer Science students at <strong>Griffith College</strong>. This project was
          developed as part of our <strong>Web Technology</strong> module, where we were asked to design a full-stack web
          application from scratch.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          <strong style={{ color: "#ff6600" }}>ChainEats</strong> was created with a shared goal in mind: to simplify
          restaurant reservations in a fast, intuitive, and modern way. The project reflects our collaboration,
          creativity, and technical growth throughout this academic year.
